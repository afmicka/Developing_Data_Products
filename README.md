This application shows density of a molecular cloud that is forming in a collision of two gas flows. It uses data from a high-resolution numerical simulation performed by scientists at the Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (ITA) in Heidelberg (see [here](http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/432/1/626.full.pdf+html)). 

With provided controls one can choose the viewing direction of the forming cloud: 

- face-on (direction of the flow) or 
- edge-on (direction perpendicular to the flow); 
    
and slide through the time that has passed after the cloud formation has started. The time is given in Myr (1Myr = $10^6$ years).
